# Scalable Agentic AI System: Enterprise Data Orchestration & Event Coordination with n8n, Pinecone & OpenAI

### Overview  

#### This repository contains a multifunctional Agentic AI workflow built in n8n. The system leverages OpenAI, Pinecone, and Google Calendar to provide enterprise-ready orchestration across two core functions:
    1. Enterprise Data Orchestration
    
        â—¦ Store and retrieve documents from enterprise repositories (e.g., Google Drive) using Pinecone vector storage.
        
        â—¦ Generate OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and intelligent querying.
        
    2. Event Coordination
        â—¦ Automate scheduling by checking availability in Google Calendar.
        
        â—¦ Create events in confirmed time slots, acting as a smart AI-powered calendar assistant.
        
#### This workflow demonstrates how Agentic AI can serve as the foundation for enterprise automation, combining data management and business operations into a single extensible architecture.

### Agent's Components

    â€¢ n8n for workflow automation.
    â€¢ OpenAI for conversational reasoning & embeddings.
    â€¢ Pinecone for vector storage.
    â€¢ Google Calendar API for scheduling integration.

---
### The Agent 

* The AI Agent has the autonomy to select any component that it wants to do any of its work

---

### The Agent Can Multi-task: 
  * (1) Can Orchestrate Enterprise Data Between an Enterprise Repository and a Vector Database (Pinecone).
    
    ##### It can then use the data in the vector database to answer enterprise related questions.

### System Architecture    
The workflow integrates multiple components inside n8n:
    â€¢ Chat Input â†’ Handles user queries and starts AI-agentic interactions.
    
    â€¢ OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4o-mini) ðŸ Š Provides natural language reasoning and conversational orchestration.
    
    â€¢ Simple Memory ðŸ Š Maintains short-term conversational state.
    
    â€¢ Google Calendar Tools ðŸ Š
        â—¦ Get Availability: Finds open time slots.
        
        â—¦ Create Events: Books events once confirmed.
        
    â€¢ Pinecone Vector Store ðŸ Š Stores and retrieves vectorized enterprise documents for semantic search.
    
    â€¢ OpenAI Embeddings ðŸ Š Generates embeddings that power Pinecone search and retrieval.


### How to Integrate the Project Into Your Enterprise Workflow  

#### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/manuelbomi/Scalable-Agentic-AI-System-Enterprise-Data-Orchestration-Event-Coordination-with-n8n-Pinecone-OpenAI
cd <your-repo-name>

#### 2. Import into n8n
     
   * Open your local or hosted n8n instance.
       
   * Go to Workflows ðŸ Š Import from File.
       
   * Upload Multi_fucntional_Agentic_AI.json.
       
#### 3. Configure Credentials

The workflow requires valid API keys and credentials:

    â€¢ OpenAI API Key ðŸ Š for chat and embeddings.
   
    â€¢ Pinecone API Key ðŸ Š for vector storage.
   
    â€¢ Google Calendar OAuth ðŸ Š for event scheduling and availability lookup.
   
* Set these up under n8n ðŸ Š Credentials.

####  5. Run the Workflow

    â€¢ Activate the workflow.
   
    â€¢ Open the chat interface.
   
    â€¢ Start interacting with the AI agent.


### Example Use Cases for Enterprise Workflows  

    â€¢ Enterprise Data Management ðŸ Š Upload and retrieve business documents, knowledge bases, or policies from Pinecone.
    
    â€¢ Calendar Assistant ðŸ Š Schedule client meetings, team syncs, or enterprise events automatically.
    
    â€¢ Knowledge Querying ðŸ Š Ask questions against stored enterprise repositories.
    
    â€¢ Multimodal Extensions (Future) ðŸ Š Integrate with email, Slack, Teams, or CRMs for broader enterprise adoption.
