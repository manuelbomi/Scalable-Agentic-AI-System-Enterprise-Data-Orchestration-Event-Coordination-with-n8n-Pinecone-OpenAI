# Scalable Agentic AI System: Enterprise Data Orchestration & Event Coordination with n8n, Pinecone & OpenAI

### Overview 📌 

#### This repository contains a multifunctional Agentic AI workflow built in n8n. The system leverages OpenAI, Pinecone, and Google Calendar to provide enterprise-ready orchestration across two core functions:
    1. Enterprise Data Orchestration
    
        ◦ Store and retrieve documents from enterprise repositories (e.g., Google Drive) using Pinecone vector storage.
        
        ◦ Generate OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and intelligent querying.
        
    2. Event Coordination
        ◦ Automate scheduling by checking availability in Google Calendar.
        
        ◦ Create events in confirmed time slots, acting as a smart AI-powered calendar assistant.
        
#### This workflow demonstrates how Agentic AI can serve as the foundation for enterprise automation, combining data management and business operations into a single extensible architecture.

### Agent's Components

    • n8n for workflow automation.
    • OpenAI for conversational reasoning & embeddings.
    • Pinecone for vector storage.
    • Google Calendar API for scheduling integration.

---
### The Agent 

* The AI Agent has the autonomy to select any component that it wants to do any of its work

### The Agent Can Multi-task: 
  * (1) Can Orchestrate Enterprise Data Between an Enterprise Repository and a Vector Database (Pinecone).
    
    ##### It can then use the data in the vector database to answer enterprise related questions.

### System Architecture   ⚙️ 
The workflow integrates multiple components inside n8n:
    • Chat Input → Handles user queries and starts AI-agentic interactions.
    
    • OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4o-mini) → Provides natural language reasoning and conversational orchestration.
    
    • Simple Memory → Maintains short-term conversational state.
    
    • Google Calendar Tools →
        ◦ Get Availability: Finds open time slots.
        
        ◦ Create Events: Books events once confirmed.
        
    • Pinecone Vector Store → Stores and retrieves vectorized enterprise documents for semantic search.
    
    • OpenAI Embeddings → Generates embeddings that power Pinecone search and retrieval.


📂 Repository Contents
    • Multi_fucntional_Agentic_AI.json → The exported n8n workflow file.

### How to Integrate the Project Into Your Enterprise Workflow 🚀 
* 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

* 2. Import into n8n
    1. Open your local or hosted n8n instance.
       
    2. Go to Workflows → Import from File.
       
    3. Upload Multi_fucntional_Agentic_AI.json.
       
* 3. Configure Credentials
The workflow requires valid API keys and credentials:

    • OpenAI API Key → for chat and embeddings.
   
    • Pinecone API Key → for vector storage.
   
    • Google Calendar OAuth → for event scheduling and availability lookup.
   
* Set these up under n8n → Credentials.

* 5. Run the Workflow
    • Activate the workflow.
   
    • Open the chat interface.
   
    • Start interacting with the AI agent.


### Example Use Cases for Enterprise Workflows 💡 
    • Enterprise Data Management → Upload and retrieve business documents, knowledge bases, or policies from Pinecone.
    
    • Calendar Assistant → Schedule client meetings, team syncs, or enterprise events automatically.
    
    • Knowledge Querying → Ask questions against stored enterprise repositories.
    
    • Multimodal Extensions (Future) → Integrate with email, Slack, Teams, or CRMs for broader enterprise adoption.

    • More Vector Databases → Swap Pinecone with alternatives like Weaviate, Milvus, or ChromaDB.
    
    • Event Coordination Extensions → Integrate with Outlook, Teams, or Zoom APIs.
    
    • Advanced Agentic Patterns → Chain multiple AI agents for specialized tasks (e.g., finance, HR, compliance).
    
    • Deployment Options →
        ◦ Run in Dockerized n8n for enterprise DevOps.
