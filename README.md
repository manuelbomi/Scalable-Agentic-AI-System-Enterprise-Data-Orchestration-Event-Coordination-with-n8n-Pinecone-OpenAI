# Scalable Agentic AI System: Enterprise Data Orchestration & Event Coordination with n8n, Pinecone & OpenAI

### Overview üìå 

#### This repository contains a multifunctional Agentic AI workflow built in n8n. The system leverages OpenAI, Pinecone, and Google Calendar to provide enterprise-ready orchestration across two core functions:
    1. Enterprise Data Orchestration
    
        ‚ó¶ Store and retrieve documents from enterprise repositories (e.g., Google Drive) using Pinecone vector storage.
        
        ‚ó¶ Generate OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and intelligent querying.
        
    2. Event Coordination
        ‚ó¶ Automate scheduling by checking availability in Google Calendar.
        
        ‚ó¶ Create events in confirmed time slots, acting as a smart AI-powered calendar assistant.
        
#### This workflow demonstrates how Agentic AI can serve as the foundation for enterprise automation, combining data management and business operations into a single extensible architecture.

### Agent's Components

    ‚Ä¢ n8n for workflow automation.
    ‚Ä¢ OpenAI for conversational reasoning & embeddings.
    ‚Ä¢ Pinecone for vector storage.
    ‚Ä¢ Google Calendar API for scheduling integration.

---
### The Agent 

* The AI Agent has the autonomy to select any component that it wants to do any of its work

### The Agent Can Multi-task: 
  * (1) Can Orchestrate Enterprise Data Between an Enterprise Repository and a Vector Database (Pinecone).
    
    ##### It can then use the data in the vector database to answer enterprise related questions.

### System Architecture   ‚öôÔ∏è 
The workflow integrates multiple components inside n8n:
    ‚Ä¢ Chat Input ‚Üí Handles user queries and starts AI-agentic interactions.
    
    ‚Ä¢ OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4o-mini) ‚Üí Provides natural language reasoning and conversational orchestration.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Simple Memory ‚Üí Maintains short-term conversational state.
    
    ‚Ä¢ Google Calendar Tools ‚Üí
        ‚ó¶ Get Availability: Finds open time slots.
        
        ‚ó¶ Create Events: Books events once confirmed.
        
    ‚Ä¢ Pinecone Vector Store ‚Üí Stores and retrieves vectorized enterprise documents for semantic search.
    
    ‚Ä¢ OpenAI Embeddings ‚Üí Generates embeddings that power Pinecone search and retrieval.


üìÇ Repository Contents
    ‚Ä¢ Multi_fucntional_Agentic_AI.json ‚Üí The exported n8n workflow file.

### How to Integrate the Project Into Your Enterprise Workflow üöÄ 
* 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

* 2. Import into n8n
    1. Open your local or hosted n8n instance.
       
    2. Go to Workflows ‚Üí Import from File.
       
    3. Upload Multi_fucntional_Agentic_AI.json.
       
* 3. Configure Credentials
The workflow requires valid API keys and credentials:

    ‚Ä¢ OpenAI API Key ‚Üí for chat and embeddings.
   
    ‚Ä¢ Pinecone API Key ‚Üí for vector storage.
